      <h1>Damped Oscillation</h1>
      <p>This is an illustration of damped harmonic motion. Here we have two sliders for adjusting amplitude and the damping constant. Adjust them and click the start button to make the body oscillate and at the same time generate the displacement position graph for the oscillation.</p>
      <p> This illustration clearly helps the student to distingush between undamped, underdamped, crtically damped and overdamped oscillation. Three main ideas which the student can understand is -</p>
      <p>1)To identify that the underdamped motion is having same frequency as that of the undampled oscillation as long as damping is less.</p>
      <p>2)To visually understand how the amplitude of damped oscillation reduces with time.</p>
      <p>3)Difference between critically damped, underdamped and overdamped oscillation and why do we prefer critically damped oscillation is certain applications like in car suspensions.</p>
